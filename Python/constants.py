# Kepler's three laws are:
# Planets move in elliptical orbits, with the sun at one focus of the ellipse.
# A line drawn between the sun and a planet sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.
# The square of a planetâ€™s orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis length of the elliptical orbit.
